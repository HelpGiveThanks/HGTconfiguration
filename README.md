## Help Give Thanks Research Project Template

This template was created out of a need for an integrated website solution combining the powers of The Bug Genie (TBG) and Vanilla.   This template is aimed to be easy to install by relatively novice users to encourage wide spread use of these tools in everyday interactions with family and friends.  Read more about the Help Give Thanks Research Project here: http://HelpGiveThanks.org.

NOTE: The repository at https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/HGTtemplate was created to make it easy to keep track of all files needed to accomplish this template in two different applications, but it is not a fork off of those applications, and so cannot be compared to them.  The actual fork off of TGB for the TGB template can found here https://github.com/virtualdavid/thebuggenie/tree/template.  The Vanilla theme files consists of a modified copy of its default theme version 2.1.

1. Purchase a website hosting accounting that comes with a cPanel Version	11.42.+, PHP version	5.3.2+, MySQL version	5.1.7+.  I got mine here and am very happy with their service: http://www.umbrahosting.com/linux/shared-hosting $24/year + $10/year domain-name plan.  (Perfect for a small website.)

     1. In Directory 'buggenie' to 'pm' for project manager.
