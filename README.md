## Help Give Thanks Research Project Website Configuration Tutorials and Files

The Help Give Thanks Research Project (HGT) website tools were configured out of my need to combine the powers of a project mananger, wiki, forum, and document creation/editing tool in an easy to navigate online environment.  Keep in mind that for all their complexity these combined tools have the same function as clay tablets used to store and access information thousands of years ago. The primary difference between clay and digital information storage is sharability.  You no longer have to be rich and powerful to store and share your important information.  

To encourage wide spread use of these tools in everyday interactions with family and friends, I have tired to make this setup and configurtion process easy for even novice users. Please help improve future versions of this file by offering your suggestions at https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/HGTtemplate/blob/master/README.md

Read more about the Help Give Thanks Research Project here: http://HelpGiveThanks.org.

NOTE: The repository  https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/HGTtemplate was created to make it easy to keep track of all files needed to accomplish this template in two different applications, but it is not a fork off of those applications, and so cannot be compared to them.  The actual fork off of TGB for the TGB template can found here https://github.com/virtualdavid/thebuggenie/tree/template.  The Vanilla theme files consists of a modified copy of its default theme version 2.1.

## Creating a Collaborative Website Part 1: Setup to Customizing Look-and-Feel

This is part 1 of a 2 part tutorial on one way to setup and configure a collaboration website using The Bug Genie progect manager and Vanilla forum.

#####A. Create a new project manager and forum for your family, roomates, friends, organization, business, etc.
1. Purchase a website hosting account that comes with a cPanel Version	11.42.+, PHP version	5.3.2+, MySQL version	5.1.7+.  I got mine here and am very satified with their service and tech support: http://www.umbrahosting.com/linux/shared-hosting $24/year + $10/year domain-name plan.  (Perfect for a small website.)

     NOTE: If you want all user interactions with your website encyrpted (not necessary in my opinion) for $40/year you can purchase an SSL certificate:
http://www.umbrahosting.com/ssl-certificates.

     Learn more about SSL Certificates here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_certificate

     !SAVE MONEY! You can host several small family website project-managers and forums on one hosting plan, setting various privacy levels for different projects, forum topics, etc. Privacy examples â€“ allow just immediate family members access, all family and friends but no strangers, etc.  It's your website so you have full control over privacy!
1. Log into your cPanel: http://YOURWEBSITE.ORG/cpanel.
1. Scroll down to Software/Services sections and click on the Softaculous icon.
1. Enter 'The Bug' in the top right search box, and click on The Bug Genie.
1. Click the blue 'install' button.
1. Leave most everything as is, but change
     1. In Directory textbox info from 'buggenie' to 'pm' for project manager.

     If you plan on hosting several family, friend, etc. collaborative websites, then type in a folder name for each followed by pm = myfamily/pm.  The forward slash = new folder, so myfamily will be a folder containing a family's project manager and forum.
     1. Leave the password as 'pass' and change it when you're finished setting up (it's just a lot easier).  
     1. Change the email address to an email address associated with a Gravatar icon: https://en.gravatar.com
1. Click the grey 'install' button.
1. Next, scroll up and type 'vanilla' in the top right search box.
1. Click on Vanilla.
1. Click the blue 'install' button.

     If you plan on hosting several family, friend, etc. collaborative websites, then type the family's folder name followed by forum = myfamily/forum.
     1. Leave the password as 'pass' and change it when you're finished setting up.  
     1. Change the email address to the same one used to install The Bug Genie (TGB).  
1. Click the grey 'install' button.
1. If you would like visitors to see a false front while you set up your website
     1. Scroll up and type 'Word Search' in the top right search box.
     1. Click on Word Search Puzzle.

        This game does not require a database and just works right away.
     1. Click the blue 'install' button.
     1. Click the grey 'Install' button.
1. Scroll up and return to the cPanel by clicking  the 'go to control panel' icon on the top menu bar.  It's the blue-postage-stamp-with-a-gear-over-it icon (the first icon reading left-to-right).
1. In the cPanel Files section click the 'File Manager' icon.
1. !IMPORTANT! In the popup window that opens click the option to 'Show Hidden Files'.
1. Click the popup window's 'Go' button.
1. If you added the word-search puzzle game for your website's false front
     1. Click on the 'New File' button in the top menu bar.
     1. In the popup window that opens, type  'index.html' in the 'New File Name' text box (don't forget to put the period between 'index' and 'html').
     1. Click the 'Create New File' button.
     1. Click on your new index.html file to select it.
     1. Click the 'Edit' button in the top menu bar to open it.

     1. Copy the text below and paste it into the index.html file: ```<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://YOURWEBSITE.COM/wsp/" />```
     1. In this index.html file, replace 'YOURWEBSITE.COM' with your website's url = name and .com, .org, etc.
     1. Click the 'Save Changes' button.
     1. Check out your website's new false front by opening a new browser tab, and typing in your website's url: YOURWEBSITE.COM.

#####B. Template drop-in replacement preparation

1. Download the HGTtemplate.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/helpgivethanks/files/HGTtemplate/.

     NOTE: If you are  using Apple's Safari browser, it will unzip this zip file and trash the zip if you have the 'Open "save" files after downloading' preference checked in Safari's General Preferences. If this happens
     1. Retrive the zip from the trash.

     DO NOT re-compress/zip the HGTtemplate folder,  as the Mac will have added a bunch of files to help it find stuff in this folder, and you do not want these files cluttering your cPanel's File Manager folders.
1. Click your browser's cPanel File Manager tab.
1. Click the 'Upload' button in the File Manager's top menu bar.
1. Click the 'Choose File' button in the window that opens.
1. Find and click on  the HGTtemplate.zip.
1. Click the 'Choose' button.
1. When the bottom-right, grey, progress bar says the upload is complete, close the upload window.
1. Click the 'Reload' button (second menu bar) if you do not see the HGTtemplate.zip.
1. Click on HGTtemplate.zip to select it.
1. Click the 'Extract' button from the top menu bar to unzip it.
1. Click the grey 'Extract File(s)' button in the popup window that opens, and then the 'close' button.
1. You can now delete the zip file to reduce clutter in your File Manager.
1. Now backup The Bug Genie (TGB) you just installed before applying this uploaded template.
1. Select your /pm/ (buggenie) folder by clicking on it.
1. Create a compressed copy of it by clicking the 'Compress' button and then the 'Compress File(s)' button in the popup window that opens, and then the 'close' button.  
2. Click on the resulting pm.zip file to select it, and then download it to a safe place on your computer as a backup by clicking the 'Download' button in the top menu bar.  

#####C. TGB template drop-in replacement

1. Click into the .../HGTtemplate/TBGTemplateNitrogen/ folder by first double clicking on the HGTtemplate folder, which reveals the TBGTemplateNitrogen folder, that you then double-click on to open it.
1. Click the 'Select all' button from the second menubar (right above the file window, and right below the top menu bar).
1. Click the 'Copy' (not move) button from the top menubar.
1. In the popup window that opens, replace the two folders /HGTtemplate/TBGTemplateNitrogen/ with your Bug Genie's one folder name, which, if you followed my recommendation = pm for project manager
OR = familyfolder/pm.

     It should now read something like /public_html/pm OR /public_html/familyfolder/pm.
1. Click the grey 'Copy File(s)' button.

#####D. Custom website ID icon upload

These next steps depend up on your selection of a custom icon to help distinguish your website from other identical looking Bug Genie websites = other families', friends', etc. Bug Genies.  You can find lots of free images to use and modify for this purpose.

HERE http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Initials

Example: Cuculcan's 2008 InicialM. Copyright CC BY-SA 3.0  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InicialM.svg

![alt text](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/InicialM.svg/200px-InicialM.svg.png)

AND ALSO HERE
https://openclipart.org

Example: ruthirsty's 2014 Green googly-eye bird. Public Domain (not copyrighted, free to use, etc.) https://openclipart.org/detail/190894/green-bird-by-ruthirsty-190894

![alt text](https://openclipart.org/people/ruthirsty/green_bird.svg)

Think of these images as icons, not logos.  They do not have to be unique, just distinctive from the icons of other websites that your users frequent.

I would recommend something very simple as these icons need to be identifiable when very, very small. They also need to visible against a dark blue background and a white background.  You could use just one icon, or a light, dark, and optional grey version of the same icon.

1. If you downloaded an icon
   1. Duplicate it twice so that you have three copies of it, and then name these copies:
         1. favicon.png (dark version)
         2. header.png (light version)
         3. Header icon.png (dark version)
1. If you get ambitious and modified or created your website's icon, save three copies with following properties:
     1. 24px x 24px dark or solid black icon named favicon.png
     1. 50px x 50px light or solid white icon named header.png
     1. 100px x 100px light or grey (hex #666666 or RGB	102	102	102) icon named Header icon.png

  Once you have your three icon files stored on your computer
1. Click into your browser's File Manager pm folder by clicking the 'Up One Level' button twice, and then double clicking on your TGB folder = pm.

     I'll refer to this main TBG folder from now on with three dots '...' in case you named it something different.
1. Next, click into your .../thebuggenie/ folder.
1. Click the 'Upload' button in the File Manager's top menu bar.
1. Click the 'Choose File' button in the window that opens.
1. Find and click on the favicon.png image file.
1. Click the 'Choose' button.
1. Click the 'Yes' button in the next popup window to replace the current favicon.png file.
1. Click the 'Choose File' button again.
1. Find and click on the header.png file NOT the Header icon.png file.
1. Click the 'Choose' button.
1. Click the 'Yes' button in the next popup window to replace the current header.png file.
1. When the bottom right grey progress bar says that these uploads are complete, close the upload window.
1. Open a new tab in your browser.
1. Type in your website's buggenie url: http://YOURSITE.COM/pm/.

#####E. Configure TGB name, theme, and icons

1. Click on 'You are not logged in' (upper right corner).
1. Login.  U = admin, P = pass.
1. Click on 'System Administrator' (upper right corner).
1. Select the 'Configure The Bug Genie' option.

     NOTE: If you get a magic quotes error message
     1. Click on the tab for your cPanel File Manager, which should still be showing your  .../thebuggenie folder.
     1. Click once on the php.ini.zip to select it.
     1. Click on the 'Extract' button in the cPanel's top menu bar.
     1. Click the 'Extract file(s)' button in the popup window that opens and then click the 'Close' button.
     1. Click on the tab for your Bug Genie, and refresh the page.

     This may solve the problem. If it does not, contact your hosting company's tech support people.
1. Select the 'Uploads & attachments' tile (second row, far right tile on the 'Configure The Bug Genie' page).  
1. Click 'Yes' for 'Enable uploads' which is the first option.
1. Click the 'save' button (bottom right).
1. Select 'Settings' (2nd option from the left menu column).
1. Type in your Bug Genie's custom name (the name of your website, family, organization, etc.).
1. Scroll down (if necessary) and click the 'save' button (bottom right).  
1. Scroll up  (if necessary) and select the 'Appearance' tab.  
1. Click on the currently selected theme 'oxygen' and change it to 'nitrogen'.  Keep oxygen as the selected iconset.
1. Click the 'save' button (bottom right).
1. Click the blue 'Configure icons' button.  
1. Click Favicon's 'Upload new icon' radio button, and then click the 'Choose File' button.
1. Select favicon.png file in the popup window that opens, and then click 'Choose'.
1. Click the Header icon's 'Upload new icon' radio button, and then click the 'Choose File' button.
1. Select the 'Header icon.png' NOT 'header.png' file, and click the 'Choose' button.
1. Click the green 'Update icons' button.
1. Select the 'Users & security' tab.
1. Scroll down to 'New user accounts' and click on 'Users can register new accounts' and change it to 'All new user accounts will be created by an admin'.  This will keep strangers from setting up accounts on your website until you are ready, if ever, to allow strangers to create accounts.
1. Click the 'Save' button (bottom right).
1. Select 'Email communication' (left menu column, 2nd item from the bottom).

     The main reason to set this up now is to insure that if you forget your password TBG will be able to send you a new one via its forgot password button, which is only enabled if you configure this email module.
1. Change the 'Enable outgoing email notifications' option from 'No' to 'Yes'.
1. In the 'Email "from"-name' text box replace 'The Bug Genie' with your website's name followed by the word 'Automailer' (to identify, automated system-sent emails).
1. In the 'Email "from"-address' text box type in  'Do_Not_Reply@YOURWEBSITE.COM' (as you do not want people replying to automated emails.  NOTE: Each user can control whether or not to receive automated emails).
1. Click the 'Save' button (bottom right).
1. Scroll up, and click on 'System Administrator' (upper right corner).
1. Select the 'My account' option.
1. In the 'Full name' text field type your full name.
1. Make sure the email address linked to your Gravatar icon is in the 'Email address' field.
1. Click the 'save' button (bottom right).
1. If your Gravatar icon is not showing, click the 'General settings' tab.
1. Select 'Yes' for the 'Use Gravatar avatar' option.
1. Click the 'save' button (bottom right).

     I will cover the other important TBG configuration options, setting up projects, etc. in a follow-on tutorial.  This one is focused on configuring the initial  look-and-feel.  Onward!

#####F. Configure top, menu-bar icon and links in file  headertop.inc.php located in folder .../core/templates/

To open cPanel files like the above â€“ headertop.inc.php â€“ that you now need to open
1. Go to your browser's File Manager tab.
1. Go to the folder specified  â€“ .../core/templates/ â€“  by clicking the 'Up One Level' button as many times as neccessary to get the main folder = ... = pm.
1. Then click on each subfolder in turn, which in this case is /core/ and then /templates/.  
1. Once you've opened the last folder specified, click on the file you need to open to select it â€“  headertop.inc.php.  
1. Finally, click the 'Code Editor' button in the top menu bar, and then the 'Edit' button in the popup window that opens, to open the file.  

If the code in the edit window does not display properly, then click the 'Use text editor' (upper right) button, which opens a more boring, but a more stable cPanel file editor.

NOTE: I put a long string of numbers like this 111111111111111111111111111111111 above each section of code that you need to modify: 1 for the first change, 2 for the second, and so on.  In some files, you may need to scroll to the bottom of it to find the first change that you need to make.  There are very few changes in any file, and all are very easy to make.  

Now make the first change to headertop.inc.php file.

1. Experiment with icon size in the headertop.inc.php file to get the icon looking its best. Click on your TBG browser tab to see how it looks after each saved change, if any are needed. Don't forget to refresh the view in your TGB browser window to see the saved changes.

    Keep the height amount at or below 30px, as anything greater will shift the breadcrumb text under the icon to the right.
2. Change http://YOURSITE.COM/YOURforum/ to your site's forum folder url.
3. Change https://github.com/YOURorganization/ to your external GitHub account ($7/month for 5 private repositories (family, friend, etc. folders))  OR  Google Drive account (free private folders, but fewer collaboration tools than GitHub)  OR other collaborative document creating, editing, etc. web tool.
1. Click the 'Save Changes' button.
1. Test both the Forum and GitHub links in your  TGB browser tab (after you refresh your TGB browser window).
1. Return to the headertop.inc.php tab when everything is working, and click its 'Close' button (upper right corner).
1. Return to the TGB browser tab and click your name, and then select the 'Logout' option.
1. Click your TGB's  'Overview' button.

#####G. Configure overview page icon and titles in file _header.inc.php located in folder .../modules/publish/templates/

1. Customize your the icon size above the Overview page's title (scroll down until you see  111111111111111111111111111111111 to find this size-control section of the _header.inc.php file code).

     Keep width and height equal as you change its size.   Upload a new icon if you need to change the image's proportions while keeping the image file perfectly square. Example: If the icon looks better wider than it is taller
     1. Download and open the icon file in your favorite image editor.  
     1. Squish it down so there is space above it, but no space on the sides.
     1. Resave it as perfect square with empty space at the top.
     1. Upload it â€“ Header icon.png â€“ to replace the equally tall-and-wide version of itself.

  The Header icon.png is used by TBG on other pages that you are not customizing, and so it is important that its proportions be changed once at the image file level, and not in every TGB file in which it appears.
1. Rewrite your site's guest overview page title and welcome message on line 68 below the 222222's.

     FYI: Line numbers only show up when using the cPanel code editor to edit files, versus the text editor.
2. Rewrite your site's logged-in overview title on line 76 below the 3333333's.
1. Click the 'Save Changes' button after each change.
1. Test the look of your icon and readability of your titles in your TGB browser's overview tab.
1. Return to the _header.inc.php file tab when everything is right, and click its 'Close' button (upper right corner).

#####H. Fix a system email issue in the file _issueupdate.html.inc.php located in folder .../modules/mailing/templates/

1. Replace YOURSITE.COM on line 16 with your site's url.
2. Replace YOURSITE.COM on line 24 with your site's url.
3. Save and close the file.

     These changes insure that emails sent by the system, informing users of activity on your TBG, include correct links to those changes.

#####I. Create a strong password for your TGB admin account.

1. Click on your browser's TGB tab.
1. Click on 'You are not logged in' (upper right corner).
1. Login.  U = admin, P = pass.
1. Click on your name (upper right corner).
1. Select the 'My account' option.
1. Click the 'Change my password' button, which is in the first row of buttons.
1. Enter your current password = pass.
1. Now, wherever you keep your passwords, type out a new one including at least two symbols, two numbers, two lower-case, and two upper-case letters in random order = e#T89Gc& (but not, of course, exactly like this example).

     Always create a unique password for each website login, as no site or web server is impossible to hack, and if your password is stolen, at least it can't be used anywhere else.  

     NOTE: If you need to get into your TGB and don't have access to your password, not to worry, The Bug Genie can email you a new password by clicking the 'Forgot Password' button under the 'login' button.
1. Copy and paste your newly saved password into the new-password fields.  
1. Click the 'Change password' button.
1. Click the 'Save' button (just for good measure).

Congratulations!  TGB's look and feel configuration is now done. You still need to set up security, permissions, etc., which I will cover in a follow-on tutorial.  Now  apply the nitrogen theme to your Vanilla forum to make it part of your collaboration website.

#####J. Vanilla template drop-in replacement preparation

1. Click your browser's cPanel File Manager tab.
1. Click the 'Up One Level' button 4 times, until you are in your website's root folder: public_html.

1. Click the light blue 'Use Display Names' button in the screen that opens to show users' full names.  

#####O. Customize links to your Terms of Use wiki page.

Lawyers need our heartfelt gratitude for creating documents like Terms of Use (no kidding).  This is an essential, serious document for regulating TBG and Vanilla Forum participants' emotions.  It lays out the requirements for respecting the feelings and thoughts of others, and the consequences for failing to do so.  Everyone who uses your forum must agree to abide by the Terms of Use agreement.  If your forum is only for family, friends, etc., spend some time, especially with kids, editing this document so that it make sense to everyone, and is something that everyone can live with.  

You are welcome to copy the Help Give Thanks Terms of Use document at https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/Drafts/blob/master/Website/English/TermsOfUseAgreement.md and modify it to your needs as long as you don't delete the required copyright references, and, if necessary, seek out professional legal help to determine if it is right for you, or even legally valid (as I am not a legal professional, in case there was any doubt).

The Terms of Use link in your Vanilla Forum will point people to a single document for both your forum and TGB, located where it is easiest to modify, in your TGB's wiki. To create this custom link

1. Click on your cPanel File Manager tab.
1. Go to the Vanilla folder .../plugins/FirstLastNames/views/ NOT .../plugins/CAUTION/FirstLastNames/views/
1. Open the  registerapproval.php file with a cPanel file editor.
1. Replace /YOURSITE.COM/YOURTBGfolder/ with your site's  url and your Bug Genie folder's name = /YOURSITE.COM/pm/).
1. Save and close the file.
1. Repeat the above three steps for the rest of these files:
     1. registerbasic.php
     1. registercaptcha.php
     1. registerinvitation.php
1. Go to the Vanilla folder .../themes/nitrogen/views/entry/ and repeat the above three step process for these files:
     1. registerapproval.php
     1. registerbasic.php
     1. registercaptcha.php
     1. registerinvitation.php
1. Test this link by going to your browser's forum discussion tab, not dashboard tab.
1. Click the 'Sign Out' button in the second row of buttons.
1. Click the grey 'Register Invitation' button.
1. Click on the 'terms of use' link just above the grey 'Sign Up' button on the popup form that opens. Your browser should open a new tab for your not-yet-created Terms of Use wiki page (unless you made a typo when you entered the url in the above files).

   I'll show you in a follow-on tutorial how to easily create this Term's of Use wiki page.  
1. Click on your browser's cPanel File Manager tab.

#####P. Configure top menu-bar icon and links, and footer links in the file default.master.tpl located in folder .../themes/nitrogen/views

1. Do a find/replace of "YOURSITE.COM/YOURTBGfolder" (NOT /YOURforumfolder) to  customize all 9 instances of this TGB link.
     1. Click the binoculars icon to open the find/replace window.
     1. If you don't see this icon, then click the 'Use code editor' (upper right) button.
2. Next, experiment with icon size and padding (5px 5px 5px 5px = TOPpx RIGHTpx BOTTOMpx LEFTpx) to match the icon in TGB exactly.  NOTE: If you increase the icon's height, you will need to decrease the bottom padding = 5px 5px **0px** 5px.

     Click the 'Save Changes' button to try each new size change, and don't forget to refresh the view in your Vanilla Forum window to see the changes.  Click the 'Discussions' (upper left) button to get back the main page.
3. Type in your Forum url, replacing http://YOURSITE.COM/YOURforum.
4. Type in your GitHub url, replacing http://github.com/YOURorganization

     You can also change the GitHub link name to Docs or something else, if you decided to use Google Docs instead of GitHub to collaborate with others on file creation, improvements, etc.  Just make sure that the link name is the same used in your TGB.
1. Save and close this file.

#####Q. Restrict access to just people you want on the forum while you build up a trusted user base.

1. Click on your browser's Vanilla forum.
1. Sign back in.
1. Click the 'dashboard' button (left most button in the second row of buttons).
1. Go to the left-menu column's Users section, and click its 'Registration' option.
1. Select the 'Invitation' option in the 'Method' column.
1. Scroll down and under the column 'Role'
     1. Change the Administrator = You from 'None' to 'Unlimited'.
     1. Leave the other roles with 'None' for their amount of invitations.

     This insures that no one can create an account while you setup the forum.
1. Scroll down and click the blue 'Save' button.

#####R. Create a strong password for your Vanilla admin account

1. Click on 'admin' in the upper right corner of your forum.
1. Click the 'Edit Profile' button below the search text box.
1. If you enabled the FirstLastNames plugin, then enter your first and last name, and click the grey 'Save' button.
1. From the right menu column, click the 'Change My Password' button.
1. Enter your current password = pass.
1. Now, wherever you keep your passwords, type out a new one including at least two symbols, two numbers, two lower-case, and two upper-case letters in random order = e#T89Gc& (but not, of course, exactly like this example).
1. Copy and paste the new, strong and saved password into the provided Vanilla-forum fields.
1. Click the 'Change Password' button.

#####S. Optional Final Step

1. If you want the 'Register Invitation' button (seen when you are logged out) to say something different
     1. Go to the cPanel File Manager folder .../conf/ and open the local.php file.
     1. Change the text on line 15 in single quotes after the equal sign = 'Register Invitation'.  
     1. Save and close this file.

Congratualtions!  Your forum's look-and-feel is now identical to your TGB project manager, and navigation between the two should be seamless.  

Your next step is to create some categories for the forum, projects for the project manager, and setup user permissions for both.  This will be covered in part 2 of this 2 part tutorial.
