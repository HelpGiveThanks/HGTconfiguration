== Introduction ==
Components are small snippets of logic and presentation that can be included anywhere in another action/template or as the returned response for an action. These snippets are called "components" when they contain both logic and presentation, and "partials" when they only contain presentation (a template).

== Components, explained ==
A component is made up of two parts, the logic and the presentation. The presentation is simply a partial, and follows the same conventions as described in the partials documentation.
