== Introduction ==
B2DB is an advanced database access library and ORM-mapper for PHP 5.3. B2DB supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL, and can potentially support more database engines via its multi-engine PDO-based backend.

B2DB gives you an [[WIKI:Active Record|Active Record]] interface to your database and PHP objects, and abstracts away most of your regular database access functionality.
