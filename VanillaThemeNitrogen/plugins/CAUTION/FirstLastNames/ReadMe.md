## FirstLastNames Registration View Update Remix

Version 1.3.2 Registration View Update Remix By David Matson (remixer), Jonathan Pautsch (original author)

Adds required First Name and Last Name fields for users and allows them to be displayed in place of usernames

WARNING: This version 1.3.2 of the plugin has a security flaw noted here: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/75796. It can be exploited only by registered users, so if you trust the people you allow on your forum it should not be a problem.

NOTE: This plugin's 2012 registration view files' code has been replaced with the updated 2014 view files' code from the 2.1 release of Vanilla, except for the code for first and last name fields which was changed to match the style of the new registration pages. Additionally, ReadMe and license files were added, and the link to the Terms of Service page was changed in all registration view files to a Terms of Use link that links to a user specified page. You can learn how to specify this page in the newly added ReadMe file. See all changes here: https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/HGTtemplate/commit/724e2b08feac0479ae6624331037e82fbe2cd24a.

To upgrade this plugin remix you will need to download the latest original (unremixed) version of the plugin http://vanillaforums.org/addon/870/firstlastnames, and modify it with the code changes found at the GitHub link above, or hire someone to do it for you. You can check at the Help Give Thanks SourceForge folder to see if there is an upgrade available, but no promises: http://sourceforge.net/projects/helpgivethanks/files/HGTtemplate/
